Hi, I'm Dorian, I study computer science in Tel hai as of 2022.
I'm using Qalculator and JFLAP for my studies in my courses as of now.

I'm working on scripting and automations to free time for my studies to find a job in the industry.
As of now, I'm scripting for my keepass database, and portable arcade - library - cinema drive.

If anyone has any tips to help in Automata theory, image processing, introduction to data bases, or intro to AI.
I will always be glad for.
